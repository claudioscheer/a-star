## About

This is a vanilla implementation of the [A* (A-star)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) algorithm.


## Heuristic

A* is guided by a heuristic. Therefore, in [`heuristics.py`](src/heuristics.py) I implemented the max-cost heuristic. Below is the heuristic mathematical formula.
